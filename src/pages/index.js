    <h1>Krisztina Matyi</h1>
    <h2>Web developer</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Kriszta. I am an experienced web developer with a background in
      product and graphic design. I love solving problems and am passionate
      about usability, accessibility, and creating digital products that
      end-users find both useful and delightful. I love working with smart
      people who challenge me to learn and do my best work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently a Senior Developer at Happy Bear Software. As part of a team
      of consulting developers I am responsible for new feature development and
      ongoing codebase maintenance for a variety of clients, primarily working
      with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. I also have experience
      building web apps in Javascript, node.js, and MongoDB, as well as
      performant websites in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, backed by a variety of
      content management systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I'm
      a Director of codebar, a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth
      of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops in 17
      cities around the world. I also volunteer my time to organisations like{' '}
      <a href="">Canada Learning Code</a> and <a href="">Rails Girls London</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time you will find me going to exhibitions, snowboarding,
      hiking, doing yoga or reading.

      <strong>The online bookseller</strong> - Most recently I worked with an
      online bookseller where I lead extensive refactoring efforts of their
      Rails app. I improved their Amazon integrations which allowed users to
      gain better insights into the status of their purchases. I also
      implemented several changes to their shipping label generating process to
      aid the work of their on-site shipping staff.

      <strong>Internal tool, Wolff Olins</strong> - While at Wolff Olins I
      extensively worked on an internal tool used to conduct yearly employee
      reviews. Built in node.js + Express, backed by MongoDB and using Pug
      templating, I worked on every aspect of the project including the API, the
      database integration, and the front-end.
