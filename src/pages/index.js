        Hi, I'm Kriszta. I am an experienced web developer with a background in
        product and graphic design. I love solving problems and am passionate
        about usability, accessibility, and creating digital products that
        end-users find both useful and delightful. I love working with smart
        people who challenge me to learn and do my best work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a Senior Developer at Happy Bear Software. As part of a
        team of consulting developers I am responsible for new feature
        development and ongoing codebase maintenance for a variety of clients,
        primarily working with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. I also
        have experience building web apps in Javascript, node.js, and MongoDB,
        as well as performant websites in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, backed by a
        variety of content management systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.
        I'm a Director of codebar, a non-profit initiative that facilitates the
        growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming
        workshops in 17 cities around the world. I also volunteer my time to
        organisations like <a href="">Canada Learning Code</a> and{' '}
        <a href="">Rails Girls London</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time you will find me going to exhibitions, snowboarding,
        hiking, doing yoga or reading.

        <strong>
          Director, <a href="https://codebar.io/">codebar</a>
        </strong>{' '}
        - In my role as Director Iâ€™m responsible for the general management of
        the organisation including fundraising, overseeing our worldwide network
        of chapters, managing our online communities and maintaining the codebar
        technical infrastructure including a Ruby on Rails app.

        <strong>The online bookseller</strong> - Most recently I worked with an
        online bookseller where I lead extensive refactoring efforts of their
        Rails app. I improved their Amazon integrations which allowed users to
        gain better insights into the status of their purchases. I also
        implemented several changes to their shipping label generating process
        to aid the work of their on-site shipping staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The internal tool</strong> - While at Wolff Olins I extensively
        worked on an internal tool used to conduct yearly employee reviews.
        Built in node.js + Express, backed by MongoDB and using Pug templating,
        I worked on every aspect of the project including the API, the database
        integration, and the front-end.
