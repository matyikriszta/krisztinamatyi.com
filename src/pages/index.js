        Hi, I'm Kriszta. I am an experienced web developer with a background in
        product and graphic design. I love solving problems and building digital
        products that are usable, accessible, and that end-users find both
        useful and delightful. I love working with smart people who challenge me
        to learn and do my best work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a Senior Developer at Happy Bear Software. As part of a
        team of consulting developers I am responsible for new feature
        development and ongoing codebase maintenance for a variety of clients. I
        primarily work with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. I also have
        experience building performant web apps with Javascript, Node.js,
        Express, and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.
        I'm a Director of codebar, a non-profit initiative that facilitates the
        growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming
        workshops in 17 cities around the world. I also volunteer my time to
        organisations like{' '}
        <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/">Canada Learning Code</a>{' '}
        and <a href="http://railsgirls.london/">Rails Girls London</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time you will find me going to exhibitions, snowboarding,
        hiking, doing yoga or reading.

          Director, <a href="https://codebar.io/">codebar</a>

        - In my role as Director Iâ€™m responsible for the general management of

        <strong>The online bookseller</strong> - At Happy Bear Software I worked
        with a client who was an online bookseller. There I lead extensive
        refactoring efforts of their Rails app. I improved their Amazon
        integrations which allowed users to gain better insights into the status
        of their purchases. I also worked on their shipping label generating
        process to improve the productivity of their on-site shipping staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The internal tool</strong> - At Wolff Olins I worked on an
        internal tool used to conduct yearly employee reviews. Built in Node.js
        and Express, backed by MongoDB and using Pug templating, I worked on
        every aspect of the project including the API, the database integration,
        and the front-end.

          A static website for Telia Company's groundbreaking Code of Conduct,
          featuring animated short videos illustrating the main concepts of the
          CoC. Built using Middleman, SCSS and plain Javascript, the process of
          building the site required close collaboration with the designers to
          bring their vision to life. The project went on to win a Wood Pencil
          at the D&amp;AD Awards 2017.
